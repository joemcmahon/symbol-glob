Symbol-Glob version 0.01

Symbol::Glob provides an easy interface to manipulate a
glob. You can dynamically define or undefine symbols at any time.

This is most commonly used to undefine a subroutine 
at runtime.

Suggested by Ovid; written as a learning exercise in 
using Class::Std for a more adventurous class.
