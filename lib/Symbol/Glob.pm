=head1 NAME

Symbol::Glob - remove items from the symbol table, painlessly


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Symbol::Glob version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Symbol::Glob;
    # assumes current package unless specified
    my $glob = Symbol::Glob->new({ name => 'foo' });

    $glob->scalar(14);
    $glob->sub( sub { return 'this is a sub' });
    print $Some::Package::foo; # prints 14

    $glob->delete('scalar');
    print $Some::Package::foo; # undefined
    print $glob->sub->();      # prints 'this is a sub'

    $glob->delete;             # removes entire glob

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Symbol::Glob> provides a simple interface to manipulate Perl's symbol
table. You can define and undefine symbol table entries for scalars, 
arrays, hashes, and subs via simple method calls.

This module does not (currently) attempt to mess with filehandles,
dirhandles, or formats.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 new

Creates the new C<Symbol::Glob> object. This method is automatically
generated by C<Class::Std>.

=head3 Arguments

Arguments are supplied as key/value pairs in an anonymous hash
as per C<Class::Std> interface standards.

=over 4

=item * name

The name of the glob you wish to manipulate. In this release, 
we suggest you fully qualify the name of the glob. The use of
C<__PACKAGE__> is handy for this purpose.

=item * scalar

A scalar value to be assigned to the corresponding scalar
variable associated with this glob.

=item * array

An anonymous array or array reference whose contents are placed 
into the array associated with this glob.

=item * hash

An anonymous hash or hash reference whose contents are placed
into the hash associated with this glob.

=item * sub 

An anonymous sub or subroutine reference to be associated with
the subroutine name defined by this glob.

=back

=head2 BUILD

Called by C<Class::Std>'s C<new> method; you should not call this
method directly yourself. Performs the necessary object initialization.

=head2 scalar

When supplied a scalar value, sets the scalar entry in this typeglob
to the given value. As a side effect, the scalar variable associated
with this typeglob name comes into being if it did not already exist,
and is assigned the same value.

When supplied no value, the value of the scalar associated with 
this slot (if any) is returned.

=head2 hash

When supplied a hash value, sets the hash entry in this typeglob
to the given value. As a side effect, the hash variable associated
with this typeglob name comes into being if it did not already exist.

When supplied no value, a reference to the hash associated with 
this slot (if any) is returned in scalar context; the contents are
returned in list context.

=head2 array

When supplied a array value, sets the array entry in this typeglob
to the given value. As a side effect, the array variable associated
with this typeglob name comes into being if it did not already exist.

When supplied no value, a reference to the array associated with 
this slot (if any) is returned in scalar context; the array contents
are returned in list context.

=head2 sub

When supplied a code reference, sets the sub entry in this typeglob
to the given value. As a side effect, the subroutine associated
with this typeglob name comes into being if it did not already exist.

When supplied no value, a reference to the sub associated with 
this slot (if any) is returned in either scalar or list context.

=head2 delete

If no argument is supplied, the entire typeglob (and all associated
variables and code) is deleted.

If an argument is supplied, it must be one of 'scalar', 'hash',
'array', or 'sub'. The corresponding slot in the typeglob is
deleted, removing that item from the symbol table.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< No typeglob name supplied >>

You did not specify a C<name> in your call to C<new>.
You must name the typeglob you want to access to create
a C<Symbol::Glob> object.

=item C<< You can't fill in a %s with a %s >>

You will see this message if you try to supply an argument
that doesn't match to a C<Symbol::Glob> method; for example,
trying to put a hash into an array slot.

=back


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Symbol::Glob requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

None.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.
